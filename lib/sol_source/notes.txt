"Secret Agency"

Some souls should be able to create other sols, some not.
capacity to create sub-souls should be visible in DNA.


mc_sol
mc_sol+nads < mc_sol

# archiving
like archive.org; it would be possible to archive all the flows
perhaps all state-changing flows.
done in distributed "seti-like" manner,
anyone could volunteer to be an archival node
then just need a managament service to balance replicaton/redundancy

# routing
using mc_sol as router- breath of "can you pass this along"


# sol 'forking' or 'inheritance'
rather than inheriting from parent sols through the ruby class mechanism,
sols should perform a fork or inherit operation from a live sol on the network.  
this allows for a 'fingerprinting' operation that signs what sol we forked from 
and who did the instantiation.
