Feature: wallets
  In order to organize my currencies
  As a user
  I want to be able to have many wallets
  
  Background:
    Given I am logged into my account

#  Scenario: user with no wallets goes to the wallets page and sees no wallets
#    When I go to on the wallets page
#    Then I should see "You have not created any wallets"
#  
#  Scenario: user creates a wallet and sees it in the join currency page
#    When I go to the wallets page
#    And I follow "New wallet"
#    And I fill in "name" with "petty cash"
#    And I press "Create"
#    Then I should be taken to the wallets page
#    And I should see "petty cash"
#    
#  Scenario: user tries to delete someone else's wallet and can't
#  Scenario: user deletes a wallet (what to do with transactions in that wallet?)
