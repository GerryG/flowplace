== Installation

The flowplace is a standard rails app.  It requires some gems, and some of it's plugins are stored in the repository as submodules.  Here are the installation instructions that should get you up and running assuming sqlite3 for your database (which is the default in the database.yml):

  sudo gem install sqlite3-ruby nokogiri gravtastic
  git clone git://github.com/zippy/flowplace.git flowplace
  cd flowplace
  git submodule init
  git submodule update
  cp config/database.yml.example config/database.yml

  rake db:migrate

=== Platform Specific Notes:

If you are installing on a Debian based Linux (including Ubuntu) you will need to first run:

  sudo apt-get install libxslt1-dev libxml2-dev

otherwise the nokogiri gem won't install.
